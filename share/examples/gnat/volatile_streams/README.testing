In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "volatile_streams.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gprbuild -P volatile_streams

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and select "demo_memory_streams" and 
the executable "volatile_streams" will be built.
You can also simply press the F4 key.

Features illustrated
---------------

* The volatile_streams example illustrates the creation and use of a memory-
  resident stream abstraction. Such a stream stores the stream elements
  in memory instead of a file.  Note that one could extend the concept
  to streams that read and write elements using some other communication
  medium, instead of simply storing them in memory.
  
  The example also demonstrates how to make maximally efficient 
  stream attributes for composite types, with the caveat that no 
  component type-specific stream attributes will be called (if any exist).
