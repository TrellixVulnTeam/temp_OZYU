In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "oo_interfaces.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gprbuild -P oo_interfaces

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "oo_interfaces" is compiled, you
can also simply press the F4 key.

Features tested
---------------

* The oo_interfaces example uses the new Object.Method notation and the
  interface support.  

  In this example six graphical objects are created. A graphical object
  implements a Drawable interface (to be able to draw the object) and the
  a Sortable interface (to be able to compare the size of the objects). Those
  objects are inserted into an Indefinite_Ordered_Multisets (found in the new
  Ada.Containers hierarchy). Objects are ordered based on their surface given
  by the sortable interface.
