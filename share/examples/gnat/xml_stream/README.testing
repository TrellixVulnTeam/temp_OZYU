In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "xml_stream.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gprbuild -P xml_stream

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "xml_stream" is compiled, you
can also simply press the F4 key.

Features tested
---------------

* The xml_stream example uses the new Ada.Tags.Generic_Dispatching_Constructor
  package. This package provides the ability to control finely the way object
  tags are read from a stream.

  In this example two objects derived from the root object are streamed on
  disk using an XML representation. Those objects are then read back from
  the disk and dynamically constructed using Generic_Dispatching_Constructor.
