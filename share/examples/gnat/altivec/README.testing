Features tested
---------------

This example demonstrates how to manipulate the GNAT binding to the PowerPC
AltiVec extension. A soft emulation is provided by default in the GNAT
library. The hard version is provided as a separate package. The API is
common to both bindings and is independant from the system endianness.

Invocation
----------

In order to compile the example, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

In order to build the executable provided in this example, you need to
use the "altivec_soft.gpr" project file. On the command-line do:

  $ gprbuild -P altivec_soft

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "altivec" to compile the
example. You can also simply press the F4 key.

In order to build the example using the hard binding (provided as a separate
pacakge), do:

  $ gprbuild -P altivec_hard
