In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "oo_sockets.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gprbuild -P oo_sockets

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "oo_sockets" is compiled, you
can also simply press the F4 key.

Features tested
---------------

* The oo_sockets example shows how to send objects (tagged record)
  over a socket. Using the Ada 'Class'Input and 'Class'Output
  attributes any class-wide objects can be exchanged between
  applications. This example uses the GNAT.Sockets unit which
  provides support for streams.

  This example could have been written with two executables, but for
  simplicity a single executable with two tasks is used. One for the
  client and one for the server. The client task creates two objects
  and send them (via a socket) to the server which calls a simple
  dispatching method on them.
