The gnat project facility is intended to specify in a simple, understandable,
separate file a full set of gnatmake and/or other tools switches, for the sake
of readability.

The project files must have the .gpr extension. The syntax of the project
files is Ada-like, and you can have a look at the fully commented simple.gpr
file to get a first idea of how it works.

Compiling a project is very simple, you just have to specify by mean of the
'-P' switch which project file has to be used:

  $ gprbuild -P simple.gpr

In the case shown in this example, it is roughly equivalent to running:
 
  $ gnatmake -Iinclude -Isrc -D obj -O1 -o ./diners diners
