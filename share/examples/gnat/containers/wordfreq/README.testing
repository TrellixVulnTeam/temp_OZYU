In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gprbuild' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the two executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "wordfreq.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gprbuild -Pwordfreq

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "wordfreq".

Features tested
---------------

Hashed map
Array sort

Description of example
----------------------

This is another word counting program, very similer to the wordcount example.
As with that other program, wordfreq scans the input for words, using
conditional insertion to add words to the map, and using Update_Element to
increment the count.

The only real difference here is that we use an array object to store the map
cursors.  We use the same passive iterator to populate the array, and then sort
the array using an instantiation of Generic_Array_Sort.
