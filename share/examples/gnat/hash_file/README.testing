In order to compile the examples, make sure that the 'gnatmake' command is
in your path. 

Invocation
----------

In order to build the executables provided in this example, you need to
use the "hash_file.gpr" project file. On the command-line, do a:

  $ gnatmake -Phash_file

In GPS, click on "Build", then "Make" and then "hash_file" is compiled, you
can also simply press the F4 key.

Features tested
---------------

* The hash_file example shows how to compute any several secure hash
  functions supported by the GNAT runtime library (MD5, SHA-1, and
  SHA-2 variants with length 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits) over a file.

  A single generic implementation is provided, which is instantiated
  for each of these hash functions, producing one executable for each.
  The name of the file to be hashed is passed on the command line.
